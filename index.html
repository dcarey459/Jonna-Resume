        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>I have been in the retail business for 38 years. I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from many great leaders throughout my professional career as a Store Manager and Buyer of merchandise. The most rewarding part of the retail business is building relationships with your team, peers, and upper management.
I enjoy spending time on the sales floor getting to know my customers and team development. To build a bench for my district and company. I always ensured that my team understood the direction of our company and made certain that our deadlines were met. I created a welcoming and inviting environment in my store, by showing up with and the positive attitude and setting the expectation for my managers and team. I treated my team with dignity, respect, kindness, and honest communication. When your team truly believes that you are invested in them. They will produce results greater than the expectation.
